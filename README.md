GemGPT is a project that leverages the Gemma model published by Google to create powerful natural language processing applications using the GPT architecture. This repository contains the codebase for GemGPT, which aims to provide a user-friendly interface for fine-tuning the Gemma model for 2b and 7b variants.

> Don't forget to star ⭐ and fork 🍴 the repository if you find GemGPT useful!

## Features

- Utilizes the Gemma model for natural language processing tasks.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for integrating Gemma with AI applications.
- Offers advanced features for text generation, sentiment analysis, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with GemGPT, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the documentation.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/gemgpt.git
```
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
    
```shell
    cd gemgpt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the application using the following command:

```shell
    python launch.py
```
To use GemGpt on Colab or Jupyter Notebook, you can use the following code:

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/gemgpt.git
!python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
!python launch.py --share
```


## Technology Stack

GemGPT is built using the following technologies:

- **Python**: Programming language used for the core implementation.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework used for training and inference.
- **Gradio**: Web-based UI library used for creating the user interface.
- **Transformers**: Library used for working with pre-trained language models.
- **Hugging Face**: Platform used for sharing and downloading pre-trained models.
- **Logly**: Logging library used for tracking and monitoring the application.
